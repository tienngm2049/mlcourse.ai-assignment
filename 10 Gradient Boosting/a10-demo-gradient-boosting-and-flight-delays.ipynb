Here you won’t be provided with detailed instructions. We only give you a brief description of how the second benchmark was achieved using Xgboost. Hopefully, at this stage of the course, it's enough for you to take a quick look at the data in order to understand that this is the type of task where gradient boosting will perform well. Most likely it will be Xgboost, however, we’ve got plenty of categorical features here.\n\n<img src=https://habrastorage.org/webt/fs/42/ms/fs42ms0r7qsoj-da4x7yfntwrbq.jpeg width=40% />"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"54de4536192c459790ecb405b25a96b994aef43c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d659e9a5cfd2ee5b982fa31cfb7b77109f9414f7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/flight_delays_train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/flight_delays_test.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8b66b8dacaef0270f63afef365f295400491613b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c9052adf73dff5f1ef4d2802f25a798eb46567e5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"test.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2c71792436f3718f22effd037013141867ad11cf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Given flight departure time, carrier's code, departure airport, destination location, and flight distance, you have to predict departure delay for more than 15 minutes.

Xgboost hyperparameters were tuned via cross-validation. First, the hyperparameters responsible for model complexity were optimized, then the number of trees was fixed at 500 and learning step was tuned.\n- Predicted probabilities were made via cross-validation using `cross_val_predict`. A linear mixture of logistic regression and gradient boosting predictions was set in the form $w_1 * p_{logit} + (1 - w_1) * p_{xgb}$, where $p_{logit}$ is a probability of class 1, predicted by logistic regression, and $p_{xgb}$ – the same for xgboost. $w_1$ weight was selected manually.\n- A similar combination of predictions was made for test set. \n\nFollowing the same steps is not mandatory. That’s just a description of how the result was achieved by the author of this assignment. Perhaps you might not want to follow the same steps, and instead, let’s say, add a couple of good features and train a random forest of a thousand trees.\n\nGood luck!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
